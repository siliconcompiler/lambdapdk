# Sky130 PDK

This directory contains files for the Skywater 130nm open source PDK,
restructured into the format required for SC. These files are tagged with the
latest PDK version number (v0.0.2), although many of the files come from
OpenROAD and OpenLANE, rather than the [golden
copy](https://github.com/google/skywater-pdk-libs-sky130_fd_sc_hd) from Google.

## File sources

### `base/apr/`

`sky130_fd_sc_hd.tlef`

Source: [OpenROAD](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/blob/2484116345a52074fee4b1755656369a2a9f75ce/flow/platforms/sky130hd/lef/sky130_fd_sc_hd.tlef)

Up-to-date as of commit `2484116`, no modifications.

`sky130_fd_sc_hdll.tlef`

Source: [open_pdks](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks)

Copied from open_pdks at commit 6d4d11780c40b20ee63cc98e645307a9bf2b2ab8, then added the `dummycut` layer between `pwell` and `li1` to make the LEF conformant to the standard.

### `base/setup/klayout/`

`skywater130.lyt`

Source: based on [this
template](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks/blob/master/sky130/klayout/sky130.lyt)
in the open_pdks repo. This is slightly different from the [version](
https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/blob/master/flow/platforms/sky130hd/sky130hd.lyt)
used by
OpenROAD, although I'm not sure if these differences are significant. This
version is used by OpenLANE (after being run through a script that
populates things like the `TECHNAME` variable), so it seemed like the safer option.

Up-to-date as of commit `b06f0f2`. Modifications:

- Used filled-in version of template post-install
- Adjusted name of LEF file in `<lef-files>` tag

`sky130.lyp`

Source: [open_pdks](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks/blob/master/sky130/klayout/sky130.lyp)

Up-to-date as of `b06f0f2`.

`fill.json`

Source: [OpenROAD](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/blob/master/flow/platforms/sky130hd/fill.json)

Up-to-date as of `2484116`.

### `base/setup/magic/`

`skywater130.magicrc`

Adapted from
https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks/blob/master/sky130/magic/sky130.magicrc.
Some contents were removed for simplicity, in particular the paths to reference
cells. These aren't necessary for DRC, just GDS export (which we handle with KLayout).

`sky130A.tech`

Source (filled-in template):
[open_pdks](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks/blob/master/sky130/magic/sky130.tech).

Up-to-date as of `b06f0f2`.

### `base/setup/netgen/`

`lvs_setup.tcl`

Adapted from
https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks/blob/master/sky130/netgen/sky130_setup.tcl.

Up-to-date as of `b06f0f2`.

### `libs/sky130hd/gds/`

`sky130_fd_sc_hd.gds`

Source: [OpenROAD](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/blob/master/flow/platforms/sky130hd/gds/sky130_fd_sc_hd.gds)

Up-to-date as of `2484116`.

### `libs/sky130hd/lef/`

`sky130_fd_sc_hd_merged.lef`

Source: [OpenROAD](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/blob/master/flow/platforms/sky130hd/lef/sky130_fd_sc_hd_merged.lef)

Up-to-date as of `2484116`.

`sky130_fd_sc_hd_merged_tech.lef`

Source: generated by passing `sky130_fd_sc_hd_merged.lef` and
`sky130_fd_sc_hd.tlef` through `mergeLef.py`. This custom-generated LEF file is
referenced in `skywater130.lyt`.

### `libs/sky130hd/nldm/`

`sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib `

Source: [OpenROAD](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/blob/master/flow/platforms/sky130hd/lib/sky130_fd_sc_hd__tt_025C_1v80.lib)

Taken from `2484116`, then modified by using OpenROAD's
[markDontUse.py](https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD-flow-scripts/blob/master/flow/util/markDontUse.py)
to set the dont_use property on the cells specified in `drc_exclude.cells` and
`no_synth.cells` in this [directory](.
https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks/tree/master/sky130/openlane/sky130_fd_sc_hd).

### `libs/sky130hd/verilog/`

`primitives.v` and `sky130_fd_sc_hd.v`

Source: [open_pdks](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks)

Generated using the open_pdks Makefiles at commit 6d4d11780c40b20ee63cc98e645307a9bf2b2ab8.


### `libs/sky130hdll/cdl/`, `libs/sky130hdll/gds/`, `libs/sky130hdll/verilog/`
Work in Progress

Source: [open_pdks](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks)

Copied from open_pdks at commit 6d4d11780c40b20ee63cc98e645307a9bf2b2ab8.

### `libs/sky130hdll/nldm/`
Work in Progress

Source: [open_pdks](https://github.com/RTimothyEdwards/open_pdks)

Copied from open_pdks at commit 6d4d11780c40b20ee63cc98e645307a9bf2b2ab8, then replaced all `bit_from`, `bit_to` and `bit_width` fields from floats to integers (same values, just without the .000) to make it conformant to Liberty file standard.
